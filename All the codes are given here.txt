\section{Abstract}
We present our experience in designing a course of Introduction to Information
Technology (IIT) for the first-year students. The main purpose of this course is
to introduce the concepts of computing and computer, and to present a hierarchy
of information technology (IT) knowledge from basic to advance through the
introduction of syllabus system, research trends of our faculty, IT applications in
society, ethics and career potentials in IT. The content of this course is set up to
meet the Standard 4 in CDIO. We divide the introduction into two courses and
teach the firstyear students in the first and second semesters. The first course is
the introduction of computer, computing, internet, ethics, and some technical
skills of analysis, design, implementation, and testing. This is an overview of
IT from the outsiders. The second is a hierarchy of IT knowledge from basic
to advance through education systems and research in our faculty. This is an
overview of IT from inside viewpoint. We also present some experiences about
the projectbased approach for labs and explain how we train personal skills
and professional attitude for our students. Finally, we conclude by providing
comments with pros and cons in operating the courses.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
In CDIO standard, the standard 4 [1] plays an important role to provide a
general view about curriculum, syllabus system, future career and beginning
concepts of CDIO for the first-year students in our university. Many similar
works in engineering have been published in the CDIO conference. Ramon
Brag´os, et. al. [2], presented a method that they have conceived, designed
and implemented ”Introduction to Engineering” course at Telecom BCN, UPC,
1
Barcelona using the CDIO syllabus and standards. The basic concepts and professional skills were given to the students through lessons and simple projects.
From that, the students were able to recognize problems of which solutions we
were going to teach in the following courses of the curriculum. Yingzi Wang, et.
al. [3], introduced the implementation of the cornerstone project. They transformed the name of “Introduction to Civil Engineering” into “Introduction to
Civil Engineering Design”. The difference is that students are put into an environment where they could learn and use knowledge and professional skills to
study design actively. Xiaohua Lu, et.al. [4], introduced one approach of multidisciplinary project for the introduction course. In his class, the students were
divided into different disciplinary groups and joined in project-based learning.
That project required students to design and build a computer-controlled tower
crane at Shantou University. This process helped students to understand the
different modules and the input/output of each module. As a result, the multidisciplinary project is a good approach to introduction courses. Proceedings of
the 9th International CDIO Conference, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Harvard University Goran Gustafsson, et. al. [5], presented his work of engineering education programs. The firstyear introductory course was discussed
and shared to improve and increase student motivation. They have identified
projects and teamwork as important parts of the first-year courses. With the
CDIO approach, a new model for engineering education is developed to be able
to implement this projects and professional skills. In many previous works, we
rarely see the first-year introductory course to information technology (IT). In
this paper, we present our experience in designing a course of Introduction to
Information Technology (IIT) for the first-year students. On one hand, the main
purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts of computing and computer,
and to present a hierarchy of IT knowledge from basic to advance through the
introduction of syllabus system, research trends of our faculty, IT applications
in society, ethics and career potentials in IT. On the other hand, the purpose of
this course will introduce the relationship between the contents of 4 year learning in the university with IT career after graduation to first-year students. The
IIT course also shows students the social requirements to IT not only in Vietnam but also worldwide. After studying this course, the first-year student will
have another point of view about their role in the development of IT. From that
starting point, it will help students to think and navigate their future career in
IT. It also influences to students’ decision in course selections for undergraduate
program at the current time or their intention to enter the graduate program
in the future. This course will also help the students to identify the importance
of engineering skills and appropriate attitudes for the success in their future
career path. From the above motivation, the design and implementation of this
course have been considered seriously by our senior lecturers and professors in
our faculty. We have already spent more than one year to prepare the learning
outcome, syllabus, teaching/learning documents, and workspace for this course
[6]. This paper will present our experiences in design, building, teaching, and
evaluation of this course to the first-year students in 2012. The content of
this paper is presented as follows; Section 2 presents the design and building
2
of course goals and learning outcomes for IIT course. Section 3 presents the
approach of projectbased learning to embed CDIO concepts in teaching and
training for students. Section 4 presents the meeting and feedback between IT
companies and the first-year students. Section 5 presents the assessments and
some rubrics for this course. Section 6 is our discussions about pros and cons
in operating this course at our faculty. Section 7 is the conclusions.

The first course is the introduction of computer, computing, internet, ethics, and some technical
skills of analysis, design, implementation, and testing. This is an overview of IT from outside
viewpoint. The second is a hierarchy of IT knowledge from basic to advance through systems of
education and research in our faculty. This is an overview of IT from inside viewpoint of our
faculty. The course goal of Introduction to Information Technology can be written into two stages
as follows;
\begin{left}
    
a) The course goals of the first course\end{left}
1. Explain general knowledge of IT include basic knowledge about counting system,
operating system, internet, email, and office applications.
2. Describe the basic values related to professional ethics of those working in IT
sector.
3.Describe the work and job position in a company, related to IT, which is one IT
student can undertake after graduation.
4.Recognize the importance of self study, teamwork, and communication skills.
5.Recognize the professional attitude, regulatory compliance, and reliability.
\section{ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACKS}
Assessment is the main difference between CDIO approach and the conventional teaching
methods. We divide 70% of final exam and 30% of project in the first course. Meanwhile, the
ratio of final exam and project in the second course is 60% and 40%, respectively. The
assessment of each project is checked monthly in three months. Figure 5 presents some rubrics
of project and report evaluation. The detail of assessment has been shown to students at the
beginning of the course. During the course, students have been reminded about the assessment
and we have also encouraged them to provide a good strategy of learning for each group so that
all members of the same group can receive a good result. In practice, the peer review gives
objective evaluation. It helps students have a strong responsibility and a serious thinking about
their contributions to the final results of their group.

Table 1 presents the feedbacks of 170 students and Table 2 gives the benchmark of score value.
We can see that most distribution of feedbacks stays on “Agree” corresponding to the score
value of 2. It means that the feedbacks of students are positive toward CDIO approach. However,
there are still some complaints about overloaded and stressful because the first-year students
have got a lot of project and homework deadlines from the first semester of the undergraduate
program in the University.
